This project, conducted during my Coastal Engineering Masterâ€™s course, involves an extensive sensitivity analysis of relevant features using various algorithms. Additionally it combines Machine Learning algorithms and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to achieve improved results.
